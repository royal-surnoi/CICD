### Why PostgreSQL is Required for SonarQube

SonarQube is a tool used for continuous inspection of code quality to perform automatic reviews with static analysis of code. It requires a database to store various data points, such as project configurations, user settings, analysis results, and historical data. PostgreSQL is one of the recommended databases for SonarQube.

### Examples of What PostgreSQL Stores for SonarQube

1. **Project Data**:
   - Information about each project being analyzed.
   - Historical data of code analysis results to track improvements or regressions over time.

2. **User Data**:
   - User accounts and their permissions.
   - Authentication details and roles.

3. **Analysis Results**:
   - Detailed metrics and issues detected in the code.
   - Data related to bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells, and other quality metrics.

4. **Configuration Data**:
   - System settings and preferences.
   - Rules and profiles for static code analysis.

### What Happens if No Database is Used

If you don't use a database with SonarQube, it simply wouldn't function. Here's why:

1. **Persistence**:
   - SonarQube needs a place to store all its data permanently. Without a database, there is no way to save the analysis results and configurations.
   - Each time you restart SonarQube, all the data would be lost without a database.

2. **Concurrency and Data Management**:
   - Databases are designed to handle multiple users and processes accessing and modifying data simultaneously. This is crucial for SonarQube, especially in a team environment.
   - Without a database, managing this concurrency would be nearly impossible.

3. **Performance**:
   - Databases like PostgreSQL are optimized for read and write operations, which are essential for SonarQube's performance.
   - Handling large volumes of data efficiently is another critical requirement that databases fulfill.

### Layman's Explanation

Imagine SonarQube as a librarian in a library. The librarian (SonarQube) needs a place to keep all the books (data), such as shelves and catalogs (the database). These books include information about each project, user settings, and analysis results. 

- **Without shelves and catalogs (database)**, the librarian has nowhere to put the books. Every time a new book arrives or an old one is referenced, there's no place to store or retrieve it, making the librarian's job impossible.
- **With the shelves and catalogs (database)**, the librarian can store books efficiently, find them when needed, and ensure that everything is organized and accessible.

In short, the database is the backbone that supports SonarQube in managing, storing, and retrieving all necessary information, ensuring the tool functions correctly and efficiently.
