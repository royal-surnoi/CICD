This Jenkins pipeline script is used to automate the process of building, analyzing, and deploying a Java Spring Boot microservice project. The script consists of several stages that outline specific tasks in the pipeline, and it includes error handling and notifications for success or failure. Here's a detailed explanation of each part of the pipeline:

### Pipeline Structure

- **Agent**: `agent any`
  - Specifies that the pipeline can run on any available Jenkins agent.

- **Tools**: 
  - Configures Maven with the specified version `maven-3.9.7` for use in the pipeline.

- **Environment Variables**:
  - `registry`: The Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry) URL where the Docker image will be stored.
  - `registryCredential`: The credentials ID for accessing the ECR.
  - `dockerimage`: An initially empty variable to store the Docker image reference later in the pipeline.

### Stages

1. **Checkout Project**:
    - Uses the `git` command to clone the project repository from GitHub.
    - Parameters:
      - `branch`: The branch to checkout (main branch).
      - `credentialsId`: Credentials ID for accessing the GitHub repository.
      - `url`: The URL of the GitHub repository.

2. **Build and Package**:
    - Executes the Maven command `mvn clean validate package` to clean, validate, and package the project.

3. **SonarQube Analysis**:
    - Performs code quality analysis using SonarQube.
    - Steps:
      - `withSonarQubeEnv`: Configures the SonarQube environment with the specified installation and credentials.
      - `sh 'mvn sonar:sonar'`: Runs the SonarQube analysis.
      - `timeout`: Waits up to 1 hour for the quality gate result.
      - `waitForQualityGate()`: Checks the quality gate status. If it fails (`status != 'OK'`), the pipeline is aborted.

4. **Building Our Image**:
    - Builds a Docker image using the `docker.build` command.
    - The image is tagged with the registry URL and the current build number (`registry + ":$BUILD_NUMBER"`).

5. **Deploy the Image to Amazon ECR**:
    - Pushes the Docker image to the Amazon ECR.
    - Steps:
      - `docker.withRegistry`: Configures the Docker registry with the specified credentials.
      - `dockerImage.push()`: Pushes the Docker image to the registry.

### Post-Build Actions

- **Success**:
  - Sends an email notification if the pipeline succeeds.
  - Parameters:
    - `body`: The body of the email.
    - `subject`: The subject of the email.
    - `to`: The recipient of the email.
    - Other parameters such as `bcc`, `cc`, `from`, and `replyTo` are also included.

- **Failure**:
  - Sends an email notification if the pipeline fails.
  - Parameters similar to the success notification.

### Summary

This pipeline automates the following process:
1. **Checkout the code** from the GitHub repository.
2. **Build and package** the Java project using Maven.
3. **Analyze the code quality** using SonarQube and enforce quality gates.
4. **Build a Docker image** from the project.
5. **Deploy the Docker image** to Amazon ECR.
6. **Send email notifications** based on the pipeline's success or failure.

This approach ensures continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) for the microservice, maintaining code quality and facilitating quick deployments.

In Jenkins, both "E-mail Notification" and "Extended E-mail Notification" (also known as "Email-ext Plugin") are used to send emails based on the build status. However, they offer different levels of functionality and customization. Here's a detailed comparison between the two:

### E-mail Notification

**Location:**
- Found under `Post-build Actions` in a Jenkins job configuration.

**Purpose:**
- Basic email notification for build status.

**Features:**
1. **Simple Configuration:**
   - Easy to set up with minimal configuration options.
   - Primarily used to notify recipients of build results.

2. **Basic Trigger Options:**
   - Can be configured to send emails on build success, failure, or unstable status.
   - Limited to these basic triggers without much customization.

3. **Recipients:**
   - Specify recipients directly in the configuration.
   - Can use a list of email addresses separated by commas.

4. **Content Customization:**
   - Limited to a standard template for email content.
   - Minimal customization options for the email body or subject.

5. **Configuration Example:**
   ```groovy
   post {
       success {
           mail to: 'recipient@example.com',
                subject: "Build Successful: ${currentBuild.fullDisplayName}",
                body: "The build was successful."
       }
       failure {
           mail to: 'recipient@example.com',
                subject: "Build Failed: ${currentBuild.fullDisplayName}",
                body: "The build failed."
       }
   }
   ```

**Use Case:**
- Suitable for simple notification needs where advanced customization is not required.

### Extended E-mail Notification (Email-ext Plugin)

**Location:**
- Found under `Post-build Actions` in a Jenkins job configuration as "Editable Email Notification."

**Purpose:**
- Advanced email notification with extensive customization options.

**Features:**
1. **Advanced Configuration:**
   - Offers a wide range of configuration options.
   - Can be used to customize email content, triggers, and recipient lists in detail.

2. **Custom Triggers:**
   - Provides a variety of triggers beyond basic build results, such as:
     - Before build
     - After build
     - When the build status changes
     - For specific build steps or stages
   - Allows combining multiple conditions for more complex scenarios.

3. **Recipients:**
   - More flexible recipient configuration.
   - Can specify recipients based on build parameters, user roles, or project properties.

4. **Content Customization:**
   - Highly customizable email content using templates.
   - Supports Jelly and Groovy scripts to format the email body, subject, and attachments.
   - Can include build logs, test results, and other build data in the email.

5. **Template Examples:**
   - Default templates provided, with the ability to create custom templates.
   - Customizable subjects and bodies with variables and macros.

6. **Configuration Example:**
   ```groovy
   emailext (
       to: 'recipient@example.com',
       subject: "Build Status: ${currentBuild.fullDisplayName}",
       body: '''<p>Build Result: ${currentBuild.result}</p>
                <p>Check console output at ${BUILD_URL} to view the results.</p>''',
       attachLog: true,
       compressLog: true,
       replyTo: '$DEFAULT_REPLYTO'
   )
   ```

**Use Case:**
- Ideal for complex notification requirements where detailed customization and advanced triggers are needed.

| **Content Customization**       | Limited                                   | Extensive (templates, scripts)              |
| **Attachments**                 | No support for attachments                | Supports attachments (logs, files)          |
| **Template Support**            | Basic                                     | Customizable templates (Jelly, Groovy)      |
| **Use Case**                    | Simple notification needs                 | Complex and detailed notification needs     |

### Conclusion

- **E-mail Notification** is best for straightforward notification scenarios where basic alerts on build status changes are sufficient.
- **Extended E-mail Notification** (Email-ext Plugin) is suitable for projects requiring detailed and highly customizable email notifications with advanced triggering conditions and rich content formatting.
